# The Site That Does things
The intention for this project is a web app where the user is presented with a console window and nothing else, they can then use the console to discover what the site can do

## TODO:
 - ~~finish off the basic style of windows (not final style just something to work with)~~
 - ~~make windows draggable within the main element~~
 - ~~make windows resizable by dragging~~
 - ~~make window only draggable by title bar~~
 - ~~make close, minimise, maximise buttons work~~
 - ~~add windows to the menu bar at the bottom~~
 - ~~add boundaries to the main element~~
 - create argument parser for console window
 - ~~add console history functionality (press up)~~
 - deal with menu bar overflow
 - ~~create start of console window (accept input/add input to console on enter)~~
 - create help 'app' for console
 - have a look at using local storage to save the users state
