# The Site That Does things
The intention for this project is a web app where the user is presented with a console window and nothing else, they can then use the console to discover what the site can do

## TODO:
 - finish off the basic style of windows (not final style just something to work with)
 - make windows draggable within the main element
 - make close, minimise, maximise buttons work
 - add windows to the menu bar at the bottom
 - deal with menu bar overflow
 - create start of console window (accept input/add input to console on enter)
 - create help 'app' for console
